This includes:\\n    *   Loading and processing datasets.\\n    *   Fine-tuning LLMs.\\n    *   Building applications using LLMs.\\n    *   Evaluating model performance.\\n\\n**In short, without a solid understanding of Python, you will struggle to follow the lectures, complete the assignments, and benefit fully from the LLM Zoomcamp.**\\n\\nBefore starting the LLM Zoomcamp, make sure you:\\n\\n*   Have a good grasp of Python fundamentals (data types, control flow, functions, classes, etc.).\\n*   Are comfortable working with common Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas.\\n*   Know how to install and manage Python packages using `pip`.\\n\\nIf you're new to Python, consider taking an introductory Python course or working through a tutorial before the Zoomcamp begins.\""
